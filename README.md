# COVID Contact Tracing App
This python program contains Contact Tracing App incorporating object-oriented and event-driven programming including GUI. When the program runs, please expect a window that displays digital interface of a COVID Contact Tracing Form. You, as the user, will be asked necessary information for contact tracing. 
- Checkout ```form_reference.txt``` in this repository to preview all the required information and use it as your guide to know what contents are included in the form **without running the program.**
